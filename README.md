### Projects done using Twitter's Data

### 1. Twitter sentiment analysis of Bill Gates Tweets 

## Introduction
I carried out a twitter sentiment analysis of 2000 of Bill Gates Tweets in 2022. William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4] He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
He is one of the first individuals to shape the world of technology and it was such an honor to be able to mine his tweets to determine the polarity and subjectivity of his tweets if his tweets are centered around negative or positive sentiments.

I used the Google Coloboratory as my IDE, I also applied for Twitter Developper Account to, be granted the permission to scrape this tweets and lastly I used Tweepy to access, the Twitter API in Python.

## findings and insights
This work has analyzed the written communication form used by Bill Gates on his Twitter posts in 2022. The first obvious result was Bill’s tendency to post his own tweets. He doesn’t tend to retweet other users’ tweets. He also likes to use URLs in his tweets.

In terms of the choice between small and big words, Bill tends to explain his thoughts in a simpler way by using small words more frequently than big words.

From the usage of grammatical categories, Bill was found to choose an action-focused and good explication language on Twitter.

Sentiment Analysis detected that Bill prefers to express positive opinions and avoid distributing negative signals on his Twitter account.
