### 1. Twitter sentiment analysis of Bill Gates Tweets 

## Introduction
I carried out a twitter sentiment analysis of 2000 of Bill Gates Tweets. William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4] He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
He is one of the first individuals to shape the world of technology and it was such an honor to be able to mine his tweets based off of the follwoing questions:




I have always admired
this great man and all he has been able to achieve thus far.
He is constantly trying to make the world a better place through his different contributions to
society like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates Scolarship,
Microsoft and the lists just keeps going.
I used the Google Coloboratory as my IDE, I also applied for Twitter Developper Account to
be granted the permission to scrape this tweets and lastly I used Tweepy to access
the Twitter API in Python.
